**NAME:**  
GALLIUM

**Description**:   
GALLIUM is an attack group targets telecommunication providers and tracked by Microsoft since 2018. To compromise targeted networks, it compromises unpatched internet-facing services using publicly available exploits and have been known to target vulnerabilities in WildFly/JBoss. During the lateral movement, a variety of off-the-shelf tools are used and some of them are either signed by stolen certificates or modified to evade antimalware detections. GALLIUM use modified Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy malware that appear to be highly disposable. The operators rely on low cost and easy to replace infrastructure that consists of dynamic-DNS domains and regularly reused hop points.
