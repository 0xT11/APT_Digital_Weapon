**NAME:**  
PROMETHIUM  
  
**Alias**  
StrongPity, PROMETHIUM  

**Description**:   
Promethium, uncovered by Microsoft, is an activity group that has been active as early as 2012. The group primarily uses Truvasys as a first-stage malware that masquerades as one of server common computer utilities, including WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, or SanDisk. In each of the campaigns, Truvasys malware evolved with additional featuresâ€”this shows a close relationship between the activity groups behind the campaigns and the developers of the malware.
Promethium conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims. It has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called Neodymium due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics.
