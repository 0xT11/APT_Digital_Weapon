**Description**:   
ProjectSauron, also known as Strider, is a threat group that has been active since at least 2011 and targeted victims in Russia, China, Sweden, Belgium, Iran, and Rwanda. The group has maintained a low profile and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of interest to a nation state’s intelligence services.

The Remsec malware used by ProjectSauron has a modular design. Its modules work together as a framework that provides the attackers with complete control over an infected computer, allowing them to move across a network, exfiltrate data, and deploy custom modules as required. 

The APT group is able to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks by using specially-prepared USB storage drives where data is stored in an area invisible to the operation system. Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its known targets, it is possible that the group is a nation-state level attacker.
