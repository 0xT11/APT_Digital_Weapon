**NAME:**  
Bisonal  
  
**Description**:   
As early as 2013, COSEINC and FireEye disclosed Bisonal's attack against Japan. In October 2017, AhnLab uncovered the Operation Bitter Biscuit attack against South Korea, Japan, India and Russia.
Unit 42 observed related attack on a Russian defense company and a South Korean company in May 2018 with similar variant that could be trace back to 2014. The main difference is that the network communication is overwritten and the encryption algorithm is different. It is an executable file disguised as PDF for distribution and uses DDNS as C2.
