**NAME:**  
INDRIK SPIDER  
  
**Description**:   
Indrik Spider, revealed by CrowdStrike, is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating Dridex since June 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits.
In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.â€™s National Health Service (NHS). Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.
