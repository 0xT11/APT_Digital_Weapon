**NAME:**  
Gamaredon Group  

**Description**:   
Gamaredon is labeled by Palo Alto and has been active since at least 2013. It primarily makes use of compromised domains, dynamic DNS providers, Russian and Ukrainian country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), and Russian hosting providers to distribute their custom-built malware. The attack group heavily relies on off-the-shelf tools in the beginning, then makes a shift to custom-developed malware which indicates the improvement of technical capabilities.
