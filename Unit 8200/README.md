**NAME:**  
Unit 8200  
  
**Alias**  
Duqu, Duqu Group, Unit 8200  
  
**Description**:   
Unit 8200, also known as Duqu, is a collection of computer malware discovered by CrySyS Labs in Hungary on September 1, 2011, which is believed to be related to the Stuxnet worm and was created by Israeli Intelligence Unit 8200.
Subsequent analysis by Symantec found that Duqu was nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose. Like Stuxnet, Duqu attacks Microsoft Windows systems using a zero-day vulnerability. The first-known installer (AKA dropper) file recovered and disclosed by CrySyS Lab uses a Microsoft Word document that exploits the Win32k TrueType font parsing engine and allows execution.
In 2015, Kaspersky discovered a network intrusion that affected its internal systems and discovered a new malware platform, sourced from Duqu and named it Duqu 2.0.
