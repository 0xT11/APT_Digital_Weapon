**NAME:**  
FIN8

**Description**:   
FIN8 is a financially motivated threat group to steal payment-card data from PoS environments, particularly those of retailers, restaurants and hospitality providers. The group has been active since at least 2016, but appeared to go quiet in late 2017. Two years later, it reappeared with a new point-of-sale (PoS) malware named Badhatch, which is designed to steal credit card information with new capabilities to scan for victim networks and provide attackers with remote access.
