**NAME:**  
PKPLUG  

**Description**:   
The name of PKPLUG, created by PaloAlto, comes from the tactic of delivering PlugX malware inside ZIP archive files as part of a DLL side-loading package.
Most of the malware frequently being used by PKPLUG is PlugX. The additional payloads include HenBox, an Android app, and Farseer, a Windows backdoor. The attackers also use the 9002 Trojan, which is believed to be shared among a small subset of attack groups. Other publicly available malware seen in relation to PKPLUG activity includes Poison Ivy and Zupdax. The ultimate objectives of PKPLUG are not entirely clear, but installing backdoor Trojan implants on victim systems, including mobile devices, infers tracking victims and gathering information.
