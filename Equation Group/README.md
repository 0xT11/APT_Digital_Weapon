**Description**:   
Equation Group is probably the most sophisticated computer attack group in the world. It is suspected of being tied to the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit of the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Most of their targets have been in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali.
Their arsenal of 0-day cyber weapons was stolen by an actor Shadow Brokers, who leaked a large section on the internet. Most notable among the dumps were 0-days such as ETERNALBLUE and ETERNALROMANCE that were later on used by other groups for the creation of infamous ransomware explosions such as WannaCry and NotPetya.
Equation Group may also link to the creation of the Stuxnet worm that aimed to sabotage nuclear reactors in Iran in 2010, and/or the “follow-up” threats Duqu, Flame or Gauss.
