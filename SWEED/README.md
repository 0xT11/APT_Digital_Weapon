**NAME:**  
SWEED  

**Description**:   
SWEED is a large number of malware distribution campaigns named by Talos, including such notable malware as Formbook, Lokibot and Agent Tesla. It remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
SWEED targeted small and medium-sized companies around the world. Based on the TTPs used by this group, SWEED should be considered a relatively amateur actor. They use well-known vulnerabilities, commodity stealers and RATs (Pony, Formbook, UnknownRAT, Agent Tesla, etc.) and appear to rely on kits readily available on hacking forums.
