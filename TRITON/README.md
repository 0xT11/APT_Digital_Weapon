**Description**:   
TRITON, named by FireEye, is an attack framework built to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers. It is one of a limited number of publicly identified malicious software families targeted at industrial control systems (ICS). It could prevent safety mechanisms from executing their intended function, resulting in a physical consequence. 
When the attacker gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation, the TRITON attack framework was deployed to reprogram the SIS controllers, to modify application memory on SIS controllers that could lead to a failed validation check.
