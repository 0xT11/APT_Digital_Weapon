**NAME:**  
Confucius  
  
**Description**:   
Confucius’ campaigns were reportedly active as early as 2013 by Palo Alto. Subsequently, Trend Micro pointed out the connection to Patchwork.
Both Windows and Android are Confucius’ targets. From the analysis of threat intelligence data inside the QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center, the two attack groups can be linked through the C2 domains used by similar Delphi dropper. Unlike Patchwork, Confucius’s targets are mainly located in Pakistan and India, and the origin usually disguised as sources of Russia.
